# Grape-Yield-Estimation

The goal of this project is to develop a novel, automated methodology for accurately estimating 
the number of fruits within grapevine rows using LIDAR and vision-based techniques. 
Traditional methods involve sampling a small portion of the vineyard, which leads to large 
margins of error. While experts can estimate quantities within 5% of actual yield, there is a need 
for a scalable, real-time solution that can be applied across large vineyards. 

The project will explore the use of handheld LIDAR (e.g., GEOSLAM) and structure-from-motion 
techniques to analyze data. The aim is to develop a heuristic model based on the shape and 
structure of the grape bunches, which can be trained to estimate fruit yield accurately. This 
method will be tested in both juice grape and wine grape vineyards, which have different 
structural characteristics.
